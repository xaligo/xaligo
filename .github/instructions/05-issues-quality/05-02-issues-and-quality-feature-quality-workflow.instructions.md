# 05.02 Issues and quality: Feature Quality Workflow

## Feature Quality Workflow

For each feature, proceed in this order:

1. Identify the authoritative contract in the DSL specification,
   architecture instructions, design documentation, examples, and tests.
2. Establish one observable invariant or failing behavior before editing.
3. Prefer a focused regression test that can fail for the diagnosed cause.
4. Fix the earliest shared layer that owns the behavior. Do not hide shared
   parser, layout, routing, scene, or plan defects inside one renderer.
5. Validate the touched slice with the narrowest useful command, then broaden
   only when the change affects shared contracts or multiple formats.
6. Update examples, documentation, and generated source-controlled assets when
   their visible behavior or contract changes.
7. Commit one coherent feature-quality slice after the required checks pass.
